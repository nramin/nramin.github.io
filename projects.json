They needed to automatically burn these builds to discs. They had a mass disc burning robot that had a SDK. I developed with this sdk and created a web frontend and client backend so that they could make their burning process much faster. Their builds could automatically burn if they wanted. They could also browse a web frontend where they could browse through network folders and choose what images/builds to burn. Before, an engineering would have to remote desktop into the main computer and burn the disc using the applications on that program. My solution made that part of their job much more effecient. This web front end was written in HTML5, CSS3, jQuery, Twitter Bootstrap. The backend was PHP, Python, and Windows Batch."
